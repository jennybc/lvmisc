{lvmisc} has a set of tools to work with model objects. Currently, the supported model classes are `lm` from the {stats} package and `lmerMod` from the {lme4} [package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html). Before starting, let's load the package:

```{r setup}
library(lvmisc)
```
